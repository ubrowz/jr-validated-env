OQ/IQ test suite — Core environment infrastructure.

Maps to validation plan JR-VP-001 as follows:

  TC-CORE-IQ-001  admin_validate passes and writes evidence file      (IQ-3 / OQ-05)
  TC-CORE-OQ-001  jrc_R_hello.R executes successfully via jrrun       (OQ-03 / PQ-01)
  TC-CORE-OQ-002  jrc_py_hello.py executes successfully via jrrun     (OQ-04 / PQ-02)
  TC-CORE-OQ-003  Integrity check detects a tampered tracked file      (OQ-09)
  TC-CORE-OQ-004  Bypass protection — R direct invocation fails        (OQ-10)
  TC-CORE-OQ-005  Bypass protection — Python direct invocation fails   (OQ-10)

Not automated (remain manual per JR-VP-001):
  OQ-01  R environment rebuild from scratch   — deletes ~/.renv/<PROJECT_ID>
  OQ-02  Python environment rebuild from scratch — deletes ~/.venvs/<PROJECT_ID>
  OQ-06  Auto-rebuild triggered by missing renv hash
  OQ-07  admin_install_R --add <package>
  OQ-08  admin_install_Python --add <package>
