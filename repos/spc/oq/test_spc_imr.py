OQ test suite — SPC module: jrc_spc_imr

Maps to validation plan JR-VP-SPC-001 as follows:

  TC-SPC-IMR-001  Stable dataset → exit 0, key output sections present
  TC-SPC-IMR-002  Stable dataset → IN CONTROL verdict
  TC-SPC-IMR-003  OOC dataset → exit 0, OUT OF CONTROL in output
  TC-SPC-IMR-004  OOC dataset → observation 13 flagged as violation
  TC-SPC-IMR-005  --ucl / --lcl flags accepted, user-specified limits reported
  TC-SPC-IMR-006  PNG written to ~/Downloads/
  TC-SPC-IMR-007  No arguments → non-zero exit, usage message
  TC-SPC-IMR-008  File not found → non-zero exit
  TC-SPC-IMR-009  Missing column → non-zero exit, column name in output
  TC-SPC-IMR-010  Too few observations (1 row) → non-zero exit
  TC-SPC-IMR-011  Bypass protection — direct Rscript call fails

Numeric correctness assertions (TC-SPC-IMR-012 to TC-SPC-IMR-015):

  Reference dataset: imr_stable.csv (n=25 individual measurements)
  Independent computation using Shewhart I-MR formulas:
